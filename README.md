# Tegro Web3 — Uniton Crypto Wallet (TON Blockchain)

Tegro Wallet is an open-source, non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet designed specifically for the TON Blockchain. This project encompasses a meticulously crafted design in Figma and high-quality source codes on GitHub, written in Swift and integrated with the TON Kotlin library.

## Features

- **Non-Custodial:** Tegro Wallet is a non-custodial wallet, giving users full control over their funds and the responsibility for securely storing the secret recovery phrase.
- **Security and Control:** Users maintain full control over their cryptocurrencies and are responsible for the safety of their secret recovery phrase. Without this phrase, it is impossible to recover funds or access the wallet.
- **Cross-Platform & High Performance:** The application is available for iOS and Android users, ensuring high performance and security through the use of Swift and integration with the TON Kotlin library.
- **Intuitive Design:** The detailed design, developed in Figma, focuses on user experience and interface, providing convenience and intuitive usage.
- **Up-to-Date Exchange Rates:** The app displays the current value of cryptocurrencies in a selected currency, enhancing the user experience, without guaranteeing the possibility of exchange at the indicated rates.
- **Open-Source & Modular:** As an open-source project, Tegro Wallet offers a modular architecture and access to source code on GitHub, allowing the community to contribute to the development and improvement of the app.
- **Independence & Responsibility:** Tegro Wallet does not provide investment advice, does not process payments, and does not have access to user funds, emphasizing its independence and safety.

## Project Goal

The development of Tegro Wallet aims to create a convenient, secure, and reliable non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet for the TON Blockchain, offering users control and transparency in managing their funds.
